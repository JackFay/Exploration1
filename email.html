<h1>Sources</h1>
<p>In this exploration, I used the following resources for learning material/guides:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh994592(v=ws.11).aspx">Install IIS and 
PHP</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.vsysad.com/2012/04/setup-and-configure-smtp-server-on-windows-server-
2008-r2/">Configure SMTP Server</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php">PHP mail() function</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Code</h1>
<p>I decided to explore around with PHP since it is a language I have never used before, but know it is 
very popular. The form below will send an email to the inputted address, with the "comments" section of 
the form being the body of the email.</p>

<form id="form1" name="form1" method="post" action="email.php">
	<label for="firstname">First Name</label>
	<input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname" />
	<p>
		<label for="lastname">Last Name</label>
		<input type="text" name="lastname" id="lastname" />
	</p>
	<p>
	<label for="email">Email</label>
	<input type="text" name="email" id="email" />
	</p>
	<p>
		<label for="comments">Comments</label>
		<textarea name="comments" id="comments" cols="45" rows="5"></textarea>
	</p>
	<p>
		<input type="submit" name="Submit" id="Submit" value="Submit" />
	</p>
</form>

<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>This exploration was much trickier than I thought it would be...It turns out that IIS isn't the 
easiest to configure a SMTP Server with, and that it requires many workarounds to actually send an 
email.

I discovered that there are (unsurprisingly) many security issues behind setting up a successful email 
server. This is due to the fact that using a function such as php's "mail()" allows one to easily change 
the "from" header of an email. This means that it is possible to "fake" an email and make it appear like 
it came from someone, whom in reality did not send it. 

The article about configuring an SMTP Server in IIS details some of these security issues. I personally 
was able to send a few emails, however, they only successfully sent to my gmail account and had warnings 
from gmail saying that gmail "could not verify" the sender of the mail. I also noticed that the sending 
of the email was very delayed. 

Many email companies have realized the importance of verifying a sender, so in order to prevent a 
warning message, I would have to file a "PTR Record" for reverse DNS lookups. A PTR Record essentially 
allows your server's ip address to be traced back to your hostname. 

Overall it was a very valuable learning experience, as I had to learn about/incorporate a variety of web 
technologies.</p>
